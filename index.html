        <h3>Our Selection Process</h3>
        <p>
            We have worked hard to ensure that all of our games are the cream of the crop.
            These are games that you may never see at your local toy store but each and every
            one is a winner.  If you have never heard the terms Euro Game or Games 100
            Winner or Spiel des Jahres Winner then you are in for a real treat.
            <br><br>
            Also, we are adding new product lines all the time. If you ever hear of a first
            class game that isn't on our list, please let us know about it!  And if you are
            ever unsatisfied with one of our games, please let us know that too and we will
            do our best to ensure your satisfaction.
